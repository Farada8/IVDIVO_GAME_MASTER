# Production Launch Handoff

Date: 2026-08-22

## Restore order

1. Read `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_ENGINE/LIBRARY_CURRENT/README.md` and current Self-Improvement authority/state surfaces.
2. Read this pack `README.md`.
3. Read `PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_QUEUE_v0.1.json`.
4. Resolve the first card whose status is `READY` or whose dependencies are proven by current persisted artifacts.
5. Execute only that smallest admissible card or bounded dependency reconciliation.
6. Persist implementation/tests/results.
7. Read back persisted artifacts before changing card state.
8. Update queue state only with evidence.

## Current frontier at creation

`PL-00 MASTER PRODUCTION BOOTSTRAP`.

Before reimplementing PL-00, inspect current repository for already-existing reusable Python/SQLite/project-state/provider/test utilities. Reuse only after exact file + test evidence; do not assume similarly named modules satisfy the card.

## Stop conditions

Stop and mark `BLOCKED` instead of inventing a pass when:
- required runtime/tool is unavailable;
- secret/provider access is unavailable for a non-mock path;
- destructive action requires explicit authorization;
- current main/authority moved and changes need reconciliation;
- a required real external/human/market event has not happened.

## Handoff sentence for a new session

`Restore CURRENT Self-Improvement authority, then restore SELF_IMPROVEMENT_ENGINE/PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_2026-08-22 and continue from the first evidence-admissible PL card. Do not replace execution with architecture prose; persist code/state/tests/readback and preserve v2 authority unless a separate promotion gate passes.`
